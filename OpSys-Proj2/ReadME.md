Challenges
    - A huge challenge for me was first getting familar with c. Although I have worked with c in prior courses and classes, it has
    been some time since I worked with it so it required me to look over documentation regarding syntax, libraries, etc. 
    - Another challenge for me was getting the cd command to work properly. I initially had problems accessing folders and using
    the cd command, and then I thought I had found a potential solution but it did not fully work, eventually I thankfully 
    got it working
